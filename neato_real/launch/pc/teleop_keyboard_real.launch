<!-- This file is made in order to load the teleop node for the neato so you can drive around.
Node is taken from the turtlebot_teleop package source, since it isnt maintained anymore. 
Unlike the similar node from neato_navigation, this one remaps the output so that it can be addressed by command_handler.py-->
